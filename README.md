If we consider the system from the user's point of view, his work starts with logging into the online store, when you enter the online store user enters the home page

Once on the home page, the user sees a random list of products, a catalog and news. After selecting the desired product, the customer is taken to the product page

In this case the user only sees the characteristics, brief description and "Add to cart" button, when clicking on it the item is added to cart, but the user stays on the product page. "Buy now" except for adding the item to cart, redirects the user to the cart page, where he can place an order. The cart allows you to change the quantity of an item, remove an unwanted model. To place an order, you need to enter contact information, delivery address, comment, if necessary, and click "Checkout".

After the administrator logged in he enters the control panel, where he sees an overview of statistics for 24 hours
